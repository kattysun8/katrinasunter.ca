    <h2 class="text-center">Why Oh Why?</h2>
    <p class="milli">One thing I said to my dad when I was about 5 years old sticks with me to this day. He lifted me up in his arms and I said to him “I love you daddy, I love everybody!”</p>
    <p class="milli">This extends to loving everything. I don’t love just one direction in the field of graphic design, I love them all! I am successful in print, branding, illustration, web design and motion graphics because I apply the same creative process to each project. I want to make an impact on people, and people are affected through different means. I want to have the ability to choose which means is the most appropriate, and succeed in that because of the thought process of design thinking that went into it.</p>
    <p class="milli">So why do I design? I want to impact the minds around me with ideas that have not been thought of before, showing useful and unexpected solutions to a variety of problems, developed through the creative and challenging process of design thinking. I want to encourage innovation by expanding people's minds to think in ways that it hasn’t before.
    I want to achieve this by showing ideas that stretch the  mind because of the story and lesson supporting it.
    I want to create captivating visuals that inspire everyone.</p>
