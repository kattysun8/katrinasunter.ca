        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Katrina, but my friends call me Kat. They would describe me as energetic, fearless and passionate, and that’s pretty accurate.</p>
        <p>Scroll through my work and let me know what you think! There are case studies that show my whole design process behind the final result. There are also three examples of brand application and execution from work experience at MediaPlus Advertising.</p>
        <p><strong>Want to know a little more about who I am?</strong></p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Why Oh Why?</h2>
    <p class="milli">One thing I said to my dad when I was about 5 years old sticks with me to this day. He lifted me up in his arms and I said to him “I love you daddy, I love everybody!”</p>
    <p class="milli">This extends to loving everything. I don’t love just one direction in the field of graphic design, I love them all! I am successful in print, branding, illustration, web design and motion graphics because I apply the same creative process to each project. I want to make an impact on people, and people are affected through different means. I want to have the ability to choose which means is the most appropriate, and succeed in that because of the thought process of design thinking that went into it.</p>
    <p class="milli">So why do I design? I want to impact the minds around me with ideas that have not been thought of before, showing useful and unexpected solutions to a variety of problems, developed through the creative and challenging process of design thinking. I want to encourage innovation by expanding people's minds to think in ways that it hasn’t before.
    I want to achieve this by showing ideas that stretch the  mind because of the story and lesson supporting it.
    I want to create captivating visuals that inspire everyone.</p>
