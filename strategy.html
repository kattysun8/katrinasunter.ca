      <div class="max-length gutter pad-t-1-2 pad-b-1-2">
        <p class="milli push-0">I start with research. A mind map is helpful, which is a visual spread of ideas born from research
          and free thinking to draw connections, creating a unique and relevant vision of the concept.
          Research involves learning about the audience. Understanding the audience is never to be underestimated.
          This step allows me to define the problem.</p>

      <div class="max-length gutter pad-t-1-2 pad-b-1-2">
        <p class="milli push-0">Next, I begin sketching ideas by using the mind map as a guide. The mind
          map creates the concepts, but the sketches allow me to draw visual connections. “Oh,
          when this circle goes into that square it create a really nice effect that pushes forward
          the intended message.”</p>

        <p class="milli push-0">An effective visual design must always reflect the heart of the idea. I am
          always solving a problem. One solution found through sketching leads to several other solutions,
          which is why it’s important to push myself to sketch as much as I can. Often, it’s about
          combining different directions into one final idea.</p>

        <p class="milli push-0">Moving forward means it’s time to go digital. Here is when the preferred sketch
          is refined through slight adjustments. It’s important to work in black and white because if it
          doesn’t work in this step, it won’t work in colour. When the colours are chosen, it’s important
          to consider the research and how the product is supposed to be perceived by its audience.</p>

      <div class="max-length gutter pad-t-1-2 pad-b-1-2">
        <p class="milli push-0">Once complete, I test it again. I ask for other people’s opinions, and most
          importantly, not a graphic designer’s opinion. Observations that I never considered are mentioned,
          and I refine the product. Sometimes, it’s a matter of returning back to the research stage and
          pushing forward once again. If the prototype works as expected, I complete the final product,
          and of course, test again.</p>

        <p class="milli push-0">Testing is necessary throughout the design process to help it stay on track.
          Like when writing an essay to prove a thesis, a design is created around a central problem
          referred to as the problem statement. I like to write this on a sticky note and stick it to
          the top of my sketchbook or computer screen so it is the reason why I make each design decision.  </p>
