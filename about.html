        <p class="milli push-1-2">One thing I said to my dad when I was 5 sticks with me to this day.
          He lifted me up in his arms and I said to him “I love you Daddy…I love everybody!” This says a lot who I am.</p>
        <p class="milli push-1-4">After I graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University with a Bachelor of Honours
          in Environmental Studies, I felt accomplished but didn’t have that inner drive to push through any
          obstacle. The moment this changed for me was when I attended the Algonquin College Open House and I saw
          the Graphic Design booth. I will never forget the feeling that washed over me, the click of everything
          falling into place. It was at this time that I knew that this was what I was looking for—the thing I was
          ready to put my all into, accept every challenge as an opportunity and every failure as a chance to learn.</p>
        <p class="milli push-1-2">So why do I design? I could say things like how want to impact the minds around me, show
          useful and unexpected solutions to a variety of problems, and how I want to inspire everyone…and this is true.
          But, for the most part, I do this because it makes me happy! I honestly love what I do because I do what I love.</p>

<!-- This extends to loving everything. I have an BA honours degree in Environmental Studies but Graphic Design caught my eye soon after. I don’t love just one direction in the field of graphic design, I love them all! I am successful in print, branding, illustration, web design and motion graphics because I apply the same creative process to each project. I want to make an impact on people, and people are affected through different means. I want to have the ability to choose which means is the most appropriate, and succeed in that because of the thought process of design thinking that went into it. -->

<!-- So why do I design? I want to impact the minds around me with ideas that have not
  been thought of before, showing useful and unexpected solutions to a variety of problems, developed through
  the creative and challenging process of design thinking. I want to encourage innovation by expanding people's
  minds to think in ways that it hasn’t before. I want to achieve this by showing ideas that stretch the  mind
  because of the story and lesson supporting it. I want to create captivating visuals that inspire everyone. -->
